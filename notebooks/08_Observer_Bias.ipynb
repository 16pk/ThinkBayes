    "The Red Line problem\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In Massachusetts, the Red Line is a subway that connects Cambridge and\n",
    "Boston. When I was working in Cambridge I took the Red Line from Kendall\n",
    "Square to South Station and caught the commuter rail to Needham. During\n",
    "rush hour Red Line trains run every 7–8 minutes, on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I arrived at the station, I could estimate the time until the next\n",
    "train based on the number of passengers on the platform. If there were\n",
    "only a few people, I inferred that I just missed a train and expected to\n",
    "wait about 7 minutes. If there were more passengers, I expected the\n",
    "train to arrive sooner. But if there were a large number of passengers,\n",
    "I suspected that trains were not running on schedule, so I would go back\n",
    "to the street level and get a taxi.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I was waiting for trains, I thought about how Bayesian estimation\n",
    "could help predict my wait time and decide when I should give up and\n",
    "take a taxi. This chapter presents the analysis I came up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is based on a project by Brendan Ritter and Kai Austin, who\n",
    "took a class with me at Olin College. The code in this chapter is\n",
    "available from <http://thinkbayes.com/redline.py>. The code I used to\n",
    "collect data is in <http://thinkbayes.com/redline_data.py>. For more\n",
    "information see Section [download].\n",
    "\n",
    "The model\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "![PMF of gaps between trains, based on collected data, smoothed by KDE.\n",
    "<span>z</span> is the actual distribution; <span>zb</span> is the biased\n",
    "distribution seen by passengers. ](figs/redline0.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "[fig.redline0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to the analysis, we have to make some modeling decisions.\n",
    "First, I will treat passenger arrivals as a Poisson process, which means\n",
    "I assume that passengers are equally likely to arrive at any time, and\n",
    "that they arrive at an unknown rate, $\\lambda$, measured in passengers\n",
    "per minute. Since I observe passengers during a short period of time,\n",
    "and at the same time every day, I assume that $\\lambda$ is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the arrival process for trains is not Poisson. Trains\n",
    "to Boston are supposed to leave from the end of the line (Alewife\n",
    "station) every 7–8 minutes during peak times, but by the time they get\n",
    "to Kendall Square, the time between trains varies between 3 and 12\n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gather data on the time between trains, I wrote a script that\n",
    "downloads real-time data from\n",
    "<http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/developers/>, selects south-bound\n",
    "trains arriving at Kendall square, and records their arrival times in a\n",
    "database. I ran the script from 4pm to 6pm every weekday for 5 days, and\n",
    "recorded about 15 arrivals per day. Then I computed the time between\n",
    "consecutive arrivals; the distribution of these gaps is shown in\n",
    "Figure [fig.redline0], labeled <span>z</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you stood on the platform from 4pm to 6pm and recorded the time\n",
    "between trains, this is the distribution you would see. But if you\n",
    "arrive at some random time (without regard to the train schedule) you\n",
    "would see a different distribution. The average time between trains, as\n",
    "seen by a random passenger, is substantially higher than the true\n",
    "average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because a passenger is more like to arrive during a large interval\n",
    "than a small one. Consider a simple example: suppose that the time\n",
    "between trains is either 5 minutes or 10 minutes with equal probability.\n",
    "In that case the average time between trains is 7.5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But a passenger is more likely to arrive during a 10 minute gap than a 5\n",
    "minute gap; in fact, twice as likely. If we surveyed arriving\n",
    "passengers, we would find that 2/3 of them arrived during a 10 minute\n",
    "gap, and only 1/3 during a 5 minute gap. So the average time between\n",
    "trains, as seen by an arriving passenger, is 8.33 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of <span>**observer bias**</span> appears in many contexts.\n",
    "Students think that classes are bigger than they are because more of\n",
    "them are in the big classes. Airline passengers think that planes are\n",
    "fuller than they are because more of them are on full flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, values from the actual distribution are oversampled in\n",
    "proportion to their value. In the Red Line example, a gap that is twice\n",
    "as big is twice as likely to be observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So given the actual distribution of gaps, we can compute the\n",
    "distribution of gaps as seen by passengers. <span>BiasPmf</span> does\n",
    "this computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def BiasPmf(pmf):\n",
    "        new_pmf = pmf.Copy()\n",
    "\n",
    "        for x, p in pmf.Items():\n",
    "            new_pmf.Mult(x, x)\n",
    "            \n",
    "        new_pmf.Normalize()\n",
    "        return new_pmf\n",
    "\n",
    "<span>pmf</span> is the actual distribution; `new_pmf` is the biased\n",
    "distribution. Inside the loop, we multiply the probability of each\n",
    "value, <span>x</span>, by the likelihood it will be observed, which is\n",
    "proportional to <span>x</span>. Then we normalize the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure [fig.redline0] shows the actual distribution of gaps, labeled\n",
    "<span>z</span>, and the distribution of gaps seen by passengers, labeled\n",
    "<span>zb</span> for “z biased”.\n",

    "\n",
    "Wait time, which I call <span>y</span>, is the time between the arrival\n",
    "of a passenger and the next arrival of a train. Elapsed time, which I\n",
    "call <span>x</span>, is the time between the arrival of the previous\n",
    "train and the arrival of a passenger. I chose these definitions so that\n",
    "<span>zb = x + y</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the distribution of <span>zb</span>, we can compute the\n",
    "distribution of <span>y</span>. I’ll start with a simple case and then\n",
    "generalize. Suppose, as in the previous example, that <span>zb</span> is\n",
    "either 5 minutes with probability 1/3, or 10 minutes with probability\n",
    "2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we arrive at a random time during a 5 minute gap, <span>y</span> is\n",
    "uniform from 0 to 5 minutes. If we arrive during a 10 minute gap,\n",
    "<span>y</span> is uniform from 0 to 10. So the overall distribution is a\n",
    "mixture of uniform distributions weighted according to the probability\n",
    "of each gap.\n",

    "\n",
    "`pmf_y` is the distribution of wait time. `pmf_x` is the distribution of\n",

    "Also\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = zp - y\n",

    "\n",
    "As always, let’s start with the easiest version of the problem and work\n",

    "    a passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Then we can use the number of passengers to estimate the\n",
    "    distribution of <span>x</span>, the elapsed time since the last\n",

    "3.  Finally, we use the relation <span>y = zp - x</span> to get the\n",
    "    distribution of <span>y</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create a <span>WaitTimeCalculator</span> that\n",

    "of the question: when should I stop waiting for the train and go catch a\n",
    "taxi?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in the original scenario, I am trying to get to South\n",
    "Station to catch the commuter rail. Suppose I leave the office with\n",
    "enough time that I can wait 15 minutes and still make my connection at\n",
    "South Station.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case I would like to know the probability that <span>y</span>\n",

    "to use the analysis from Section [elapsed] and run it for a range of\n",
    "`num_passengers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there’s a problem. The analysis is sensitive to the frequency of\n",
    "long delays, and because long delays are rare, it is hard estimate their\n",
    "frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "I only have data from one week, and the longest delay I observed was 15\n",
    "minutes. So I can’t estimate the frequency of longer delays accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I can use previous observations to make at least a coarse\n",
    "estimate. When I commuted by Red Line for a year, I saw three long\n",
    "delays caused by a signaling problem, a power outage, and “police\n",
    "activity” at another stop. So I estimate that there are about 3 major\n",
    "delays per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember that my observations are biased. I am more likely to\n",
    "observe long delays because they affect a large number of passengers. So\n",
    "we should treat my observations as a sample of <span>zb</span> rather\n",
    "than <span>z</span>. Here’s how we can do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "During my year of commuting, I took the Red Line home about 220 times.\n",
    "So I take the observed gap times, `gap_times`, generate a sample of 220\n",
    "gaps, and compute their Pmf:\n",
    "\n",
    "        n = 220\n",
    "        cdf_z = thinkbayes.MakeCdfFromList(gap_times)\n",
    "        sample_z = cdf_z.Sample(n)\n",
    "        pmf_z = thinkbayes.MakePmfFromList(sample_z)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I bias `pmf_z` to get the distribution of <span>zb</span>, draw a\n",
    "sample, and then add in delays of 30, 40, and 50 minutes (expressed in\n",
    "seconds):\n",
    "\n",
    "        cdf_zp = BiasPmf(pmf_z).MakeCdf()\n",
    "        sample_zb = cdf_zp.Sample(n) + [1800, 2400, 3000]\n",
    "\n",
    "<span>Cdf.Sample</span> is more efficient than <span>Pmf.Sample</span>,\n",
    "so it is usually faster to convert a Pmf to a Cdf before sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next I use the sample of <span>zb</span> to estimate a Pdf using KDE,\n",
    "and then convert the Pdf to a Pmf:\n",
    "\n",
    "        pdf_zb = thinkbayes.EstimatedPdf(sample_zb)\n",
    "        xs = MakeRange(low=60)\n",
    "        pmf_zb = pdf_zb.MakePmf(xs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I unbias the distribution of <span>zb</span> to get the\n",
    "distribution of <span>z</span>, which I use to create the\n",
    "<span>WaitTimeCalculator</span>:\n",
    "\n",
    "        pmf_z = UnbiasPmf(pmf_zb)\n",
    "        wtc = WaitTimeCalculator(pmf_z)\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is complicated, but all of the steps are operations we have\n",
    "seen before. Now we are ready to compute the probability of a long wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def ProbLongWait(num_passengers, minutes):\n",
    "        ete = ElapsedTimeEstimator(wtc, lam, num_passengers)\n",
    "        cdf_y = ete.pmf_y.MakeCdf()\n",
    "        prob = 1 - cdf_y.Prob(minutes * 60)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the number of passengers on the platform,\n",
    "<span>ProbLongWait</span> makes an <span>ElapsedTimeEstimator</span>,\n",
    "extracts the distribution of wait time, and computes the probability\n",
    "that wait time exceeds <span>minutes</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure [fig.redline5] shows the result. When the number of passengers is\n",
    "less than 20, we infer that the system is operating normally, so the\n",
    "probability of a long delay is small. If there are 30 passengers, we\n",
    "estimate that it has been 15 minutes since the last train; that’s longer\n",
    "than a normal delay, so we infer that something is wrong and expect\n",
    "longer delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are willing to accept a 10% chance of missing the connection at\n",
    "South Station, we should stay and wait as long as there are fewer than\n",
    "30 passengers, and take a taxi if there are more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, to take this analysis one step further, we could quantify the cost\n",
    "of missing the connection and the cost of taking a taxi, then choose the\n",
    "threshold that minimizes expected cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis so far has been based on the assumption that the arrival\n",
    "rate of passengers is the same every day. For a commuter train during\n",
    "rush hour, that might not be a bad assumption, but there are some\n",
    "obvious exceptions. For example, if there is a special event nearby, a\n",
    "large number of people might arrive at the same time. In that case, the\n",
    "estimate of <span>lam</span> would be too low, so the estimates of\n",
    "<span>x</span> and <span>y</span> would be too high.\n",
    "\n",
    "If special events are as common as major delays, it would be important\n",
    "to include them in the model. We could do that by extending the\n",
    "distribution of <span>lam</span> to include occasional large values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with the assumption that we know distribution of\n",
    "<span>z</span>. As an alternative, a passenger could estimate\n",
    "<span>z</span>, but it would not be easy. As a passenger, you only\n",
    "observe only your own wait time, <span>y</span>. Unless you skip the\n",
    "first train and wait for the second, you don’t observe the gap between\n",
    "trains, <span>z</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we could make some inferences about <span>zb</span>. If we note\n",
    "the number of passengers waiting when we arrive, we can estimate the\n",
    "elapsed time since the last train, <span>x</span>. Then we observe\n",
    "<span>y</span>. If we add the posterior distribution of <span>x</span>\n",
    "to the observed <span>y</span>, we get a distribution that represents\n",
    "our posterior belief about the observed value of <span>zb</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this distribution to update our beliefs about the\n",
    "distribution of <span>zb</span>. Finally, we can compute the inverse of\n",
    "<span>BiasPmf</span> to get from the distribution of <span>zb</span> to\n",
    "the distribution of <span>z</span>.\n",
