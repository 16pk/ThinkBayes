    "Paintball is a sport in which competing teams try to shoot each other\n",
    "with guns that fire paint-filled pellets that break on impact, leaving a\n",
    "colorful mark on the target. It is usually played in an arena decorated\n",
    "with barriers and other objects that can be used as cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are playing paintball in an indoor arena 30 feet wide and 50\n",
    "feet long. You are standing near one of the 30 foot walls, and you\n",
    "suspect that one of your opponents has taken cover nearby. Along the\n",
    "wall, you see several paint spatters, all the same color, that you think\n",
    "your opponent fired recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatters are at 15, 16, 18, and 21 feet, measured from the\n",
    "lower-left corner of the room. Based on these data, where do you think\n",
    "your opponent is hiding?\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure [fig.paintball] shows a diagram of the arena. Using the\n",
    "lower-left corner of the room as the origin, I denote the unknown\n",
    "location of the shooter with coordinates $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, or\n",
    "<span>alpha</span> and <span>beta</span>. The location of a spatter is\n",
    "labeled <span>x</span>. The angle the opponent shoots at is $\\theta$ or\n",

    "\n",
    "As a simple model, imagine that the opponent is like a rotating turret,\n",

    "to hit the wall far away from <span>alpha</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a little trigonometry, we can compute the probability of hitting\n",

    "$\\theta$; the pellet would hit the wall at location $x$, where\n",
    "$$x - \\alpha = \\beta \\tan \\theta$$ Solving this equation for $\\theta$\n",
    "yields $$\\theta = tan^{-1} \\left( \\frac{x - \\alpha}{\\beta} \\right)$$ So\n",
    "given a location on the wall, we can find $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the derivative of the first equation with respect to $\\theta$\n",
    "yields $$\\frac{dx}{d\\theta} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\cos^2 \\theta}$$ This\n",
    "derivative is what I’ll call the “strafing speed”, which is the speed of\n",
    "the target location along the wall as $\\theta$ increases. The\n",
    "probability of hitting a given point on the wall is inversely related to\n",
    "strafing speed.\n",

    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "When each value in a distribution is a tuple of variables, it is called\n",
    "a <span>**joint distribution**</span> because it represents the\n",
    "distributions of the variables together, that is “jointly”. A joint\n",
    "distribution contains the distributions of the variables, as well\n",
    "information about the relationships among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a joint distribution, we can compute the distributions of each\n",
    "variable independently, which are called the <span>**marginal\n",
    "distributions**</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span>thinkbayes.Joint</span> provides a method that computes marginal\n",

    "                pmf.Incr(vs[i], prob)\n",
    "            return pmf\n",
    "\n",
    "<span>i</span> is the index of the variable we want; in this example\n",
    "<span>i=0</span> indicates the distribution of <span>alpha</span>, and\n",
    "<span>i=1</span> indicates the distribution of <span>beta</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the code that extracts the marginal distributions:\n",
    "\n",
    "        marginal_alpha = suite.Marginal(0)\n",
    "        marginal_beta = suite.Marginal(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure [fig.paintball2] shows the results (converted to CDFs). The\n",
    "median value for <span>alpha</span> is 18, near the center of mass of\n",
    "the observed spatters. For <span>beta</span>, the most likely values are\n",
    "close to the wall, but beyond 10 feet the distribution is almost\n",
    "uniform, which indicates that the data do not distinguish strongly\n",
    "between these possible locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the posterior marginals, we can compute credible intervals for\n",
    "each coordinate independently:\n",
    "\n",
    "        print 'alpha CI', marginal_alpha.CredibleInterval(50)\n",

    "<span>alpha</span> and <span>(5, 31)</span> for <span>beta</span>. So\n",
    "the data provide evidence that the shooter is in the near side of the\n",
    "room. But it is not strong evidence. The 90% credible intervals cover\n",
    "most of the room!\n",

    "Conditional distributions {#conditional}\n",

    "values of <span>beta</span>.](figs/paintball3.pdf)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "One way to visualize dependence is by computing <span>**conditional\n",

    "\n",
    "            pmf.Normalize()\n",

    "\n",
    "Again, <span>i</span> is the index of the variable we want;\n",
    "<span>j</span> is the index of the conditioning variable, and\n",
    "<span>val</span> is the conditional value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is the distribution of the $i$th variable under the condition\n",
    "that the $j$th variable is <span>val</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code computes the conditional distributions\n",
    "of <span>alpha</span> for a range of values of <span>beta</span>:\n",
    "\n",
    "        betas = [10, 20, 40]\n",

    "as “posterior conditional marginal distributions.” Whew!\n",
    "\n",
    "If the variables were independent, the conditional distributions would\n",
    "all be the same. Since they are all different, we can tell the variables\n",
    "are dependent. For example, if we know (somehow) that <span>beta =\n",
    "10</span>, the conditional distribution of <span>alpha</span> is fairly\n",
    "narrow. For larger values of <span>beta</span>, the distribution of\n",

    "Another way to visualize the posterior joint distribution is to compute\n",
    "credible intervals. When we looked at credible intervals in\n",
    "Section [credible], I skipped over a subtle point: for a given\n",
    "distribution, there are many intervals with the same level of\n",
    "credibility. For example, if you want a 50% credible interval, you could\n",
    "choose any set of values whose probability adds up to 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the values are one-dimensional, it is most common to choose the\n",
    "<span>**central credible interval**</span>; for example, the central 50%\n",
    "credible interval contains all values between the 25th and 75th\n",
    "percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple dimensions it is less obvious what the right credible\n",
    "interval should be. The best choice might depend on context, but one\n",
    "common choice is the maximum likelihood credible interval, which\n",

    "\n",
    "Marginal distribution:\n",
    ":   The distribution of one parameter in a joint distribution, treating\n",
    "    the other parameters as unknown. For example,\n",

    "Given the joint distribution, you can compute marginal and conditional\n",
