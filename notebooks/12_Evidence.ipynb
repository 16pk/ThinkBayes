    "Interpreting SAT scores\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are the Dean of Admission at a small engineering college in\n",
    "Massachusetts, and you are considering two candidates, Alice and Bob,\n",
    "whose qualifications are similar in many ways, with the exception that\n",
    "Alice got a higher score on the Math portion of the SAT, a standardized\n",
    "test intended to measure preparation for college-level work in\n",
    "mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Alice got 780 and Bob got a 740 (out of a possible 800), you might\n",
    "want to know whether that difference is evidence that Alice is better\n",
    "prepared than Bob, and what the strength of that evidence is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in reality, both scores are very good, and both candidates are\n",
    "probably well prepared for college math. So the real Dean of Admission\n",
    "would probably suggest that we choose the candidate who best\n",
    "demonstrates the other skills and attitudes we look for in students. But\n",
    "as an example of Bayesian hypothesis testing, let’s stick with a\n",
    "narrower question: “How strong is the evidence that Alice is better\n",
    "prepared than Bob?”\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer that question, we need to make some modeling decisions. I’ll\n",
    "start with a simplification I know is wrong; then we’ll come back and\n",
    "improve the model. I pretend, temporarily, that all SAT questions are\n",
    "equally difficult. Actually, the designers of the SAT choose questions\n",
    "with a range of difficulty, because that improves the ability to measure\n",
    "statistical differences between test-takers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we choose a model where all questions are equally difficult, we\n",
    "can define a characteristic, `p_correct`, for each test-taker, which is\n",
    "the probability of answering any question correctly. This simplification\n",
    "makes it easy to compute the likelihood of a given score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scale\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand SAT scores, we have to understand the scoring and\n",
    "scaling process. Each test-taker gets a raw score based on the number of\n",
    "correct and incorrect questions. The raw score is converted to a scaled\n",
    "score in the range 200–800.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2009, there were 54 questions on the math SAT. The raw score for each\n",
    "test-taker is the number of questions answered correctly minus a penalty\n",
    "of $1/4$ point for each question answered incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The College Board, which administers the SAT, publishes the map from raw\n",
    "scores to scaled scores. I have downloaded that data and wrapped it in\n",
    "an Interpolator object that provides a forward lookup (from raw score to\n",
    "scaled) and a reverse lookup (from scaled score to raw).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the code for this example from\n",
    "<http://thinkbayes.com/sat.py>. For more information see\n",
    "Section [download].\n",
    "\n",
    "The prior\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "The College Board also publishes the distribution of scaled scores for\n",
    "all test-takers. If we convert each scaled score to a raw score, and\n",
    "divide by the number of questions, the result is an estimate of\n",
    "`p_correct`. So we can use the distribution of raw scores to model the\n",
    "prior distribution of `p_correct`.\n",

    "outside that range.\n",

    "Figure [fig.satposterior1] shows the posterior distributions of\n",
    "`p_correct` for Alice and Bob based on their exam scores. We can see\n",
    "that they overlap, so it is possible that `p_correct` is actually higher\n",
    "for Bob, but it seems unlikely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which brings us back to the original question, “How strong is the\n",
    "evidence that Alice is better prepared than Bob?” We can use the\n",
    "posterior distributions of `p_correct` to answer this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formulate the question in terms of Bayesian hypothesis testing, I\n",
    "define two hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $A$: `p_correct` is higher for Alice than for Bob.\n",

    "`c_like` is the probability that they are “equal,” but this equality is\n",

    "values. If we use more values, `c_like` is smaller, and in the extreme,\n",
    "if `p_correct` is continuous, `c_like` is zero. So I treat `c_like` as a\n",

    "\n",
    "The likelihood of $A$ is 0.79 and the likelihood of $B$ is 0.21. The\n",
    "likelihood ratio (or Bayes factor) is 3.8, which means that these test\n",
    "scores are evidence that Alice is better than Bob at answering SAT\n",
    "questions. If we believed, before seeing the test scores, that $A$ and\n",
    "$B$ were equally likely, then after seeing the scores we should believe\n",
    "that the probability of $A$ is 79%, which means there is still a 21%\n",

    "\n",
    "A better model\n",

    "\n",
    "In the next few sections, I develop a better model and discover (spoiler\n",

    "Figure [fig.satposterior2] shows the posterior distributions of efficacy\n",
    "for Alice and Bob. As expected, the location of Alice’s distribution is\n",
    "farther to the right, but again there is some overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using <span>TopLevel</span> again, we compare $A$, the hypothesis that\n",
    "Alice’s efficacy is higher, and $B$, the hypothesis that Bob’s is\n",
    "higher. The likelihood ratio is 3.4, a bit smaller than what we got from\n",
    "the simple model (3.8). So this model indicates that the data are\n",
    "evidence in favor of $A$, but a little weaker than the previous\n",
    "estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our prior belief is that $A$ and $B$ are equally likely, then in\n",
    "light of this evidence we would give $A$ a posterior probability of 77%,\n",
    "leaving a 23% chance that Bob’s efficacy is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive distribution\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis we have done so far generates estimates for Alice and Bob’s\n",
    "efficacy, but since efficacy is not directly observable, it is hard to\n",
    "validate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give the model predictive power, we can use it to answer a related\n",
    "question: “If Alice and Bob take the math SAT again, what is the chance\n",
    "that Alice will do better again?”\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll answer this question in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We’ll use the posterior distribution of efficacy to generate a\n",
    "    predictive distribution of raw score for each test-taker.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   We’ll compare the two predictive distributions to compute the\n",
    "    probability that Alice gets a higher score again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already have most of the code we need. To compute the predictive\n",
    "distributions, we can use `MakeRawScoreDist` again:\n",
    "\n",
    "        exam = Exam()\n",
    "        a_sat = Sat(exam, 780)\n",
    "        b_sat = Sat(exam, 740)\n",
    "\n",
    "        a_pred = exam.MakeRawScoreDist(a_sat)\n",
    "        b_pred = exam.MakeRawScoreDist(b_sat)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can find the likelihood that Alice does better on the second\n",
    "test, Bob does better, or they tie:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a_like = thinkbayes.PmfProbGreater(a_pred, b_pred)\n",
    "        b_like = thinkbayes.PmfProbLess(a_pred, b_pred)\n",
    "        c_like = thinkbayes.PmfProbEqual(a_pred, b_pred)\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that Alice does better on the second exam is 63%, which\n",
    "means that Bob has a 37% chance of doing as well or better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have more confidence about Alice’s efficacy than we do\n",
    "about the outcome of the next test. The posterior odds are 3:1 that\n",
    "Alice’s efficacy is higher, but only 2:1 that Alice will do better on\n",
    "the next exam.\n",

    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "![Joint posterior distribution of <span>p\\_correct</span> for Alice and\n",
    "Bob.](figs/sat_joint.pdf)\n",

    "[fig.satjoint]\n",
    "\n",
    "We started this chapter with the question, “How strong is the evidence\n",
    "that Alice is better prepared than Bob?” On the face of it, that sounds\n",
    "like we want to test two hypotheses: either Alice is more prepared or\n",
    "Bob is.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in order to compute likelihoods for these hypotheses, we have to\n",
    "solve an estimation problem. For each test-taker we have to find the\n",
    "posterior distribution of either `p_correct` or `efficacy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values like this are called <span>**nuisance parameters**</span> because\n",
    "we don’t care what they are, but we have to estimate them to answer the\n",
    "question we care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to visualize the analysis we did in this chapter is to plot the\n",
    "space of these parameters. `thinkbayes.MakeJoint` takes two Pmfs,\n",
    "computes their joint distribution, and returns a joint pmf of each\n",
    "possible pair of values and its probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def MakeJoint(pmf1, pmf2):\n",
    "        joint = Joint()\n",
    "        for v1, p1 in pmf1.Items():\n",
    "            for v2, p2 in pmf2.Items():\n",
    "                joint.Set((v1, v2), p1 * p2)\n",
    "        return joint\n",
    "\n",
    "This function assumes that the two distributions are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure [fig.satjoint] shows the joint posterior distribution of\n",
    "`p_correct` for Alice and Bob. The diagonal line indicates the part of\n",
    "the space where `p_correct` is the same for Alice and Bob. To the right\n",
    "of this line, Alice is more prepared; to the left, Bob is more prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "In <span>TopLevel.Update</span>, when we compute the likelihoods of $A$\n",
    "and $B$, we add up the probability mass on each side of this line. For\n",
    "the cells that fall on the line, we add up the total mass and split it\n",
    "between $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process we used in this chapter—estimating nuisance parameters in\n",
    "order to evaluate the likelihood of competing hypotheses—is a common\n",
    "Bayesian approach to problems like this.\n"
