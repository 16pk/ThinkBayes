    "The Kidney Tumor problem\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a frequent reader and occasional contributor to the online\n",
    "statistics forum at <http://reddit.com/r/statistics>. In November 2011,\n",
    "I read the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “I have Stage IV Kidney Cancer and am trying to determine if the\n",
    "> cancer formed before I retired from the military. ... Given the dates\n",
    "> of retirement and detection is it possible to determine when there was\n",
    "> a 50/50 chance that I developed the disease? Is it possible to\n",
    "> determine the probability on the retirement date? My tumor was 15.5 cm\n",
    "> x 15 cm at detection. Grade II.”\n",
    "\n",
    "I contacted the author of the message and got more information; I\n",
    "learned that veterans get different benefits if it is “more likely than\n",
    "not” that a tumor formed while they were in military service (among\n",
    "other considerations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because renal tumors grow slowly, and often do not cause symptoms, they\n",
    "are sometimes left untreated. As a result, doctors can observe the rate\n",
    "of growth for untreated tumors by comparing scans from the same patient\n",
    "at different times. Several papers have reported these growth rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "I collected data from a paper by Zhang et al[^3]. I contacted the\n",
    "authors to see if I could get raw data, but they refused on grounds of\n",
    "medical privacy. Nevertheless, I was able to extract the data I needed\n",
    "by printing one of their graphs and measuring it with a ruler.\n",

    "![CDF of RDT in doublings per year.](figs/kidney2.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "[fig.kidney2]\n",
    "\n",
    "They report growth rates in reciprocal doubling time (RDT), which is in\n",
    "units of doublings per year. So a tumor with $RDT=1$ doubles in volume\n",
    "each year; with $RDT=2$ it quadruples in the same time, and with\n",
    "$RDT=-1$, it halves. Figure [fig.kidney2] shows the distribution of RDT\n",
    "for 53 patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The squares are the data points from the paper; the line is a model I\n",
    "fit to the data. The positive tail fits an exponential distribution\n",
    "well, so I used a mixture of two exponentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple model\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually a good idea to start with a simple model before trying\n",
    "something more challenging. Sometimes the simple model is sufficient for\n",
    "the problem at hand, and if not, you can use it to validate the more\n",
    "complex model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For my simple model, I assume that tumors grow with a constant doubling\n",
    "time, and that they are three-dimensional in the sense that if the\n",
    "maximum linear measurement doubles, the volume is multiplied by eight.\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned from my correspondent that the time between his discharge from\n",
    "the military and his diagnosis was 3291 days (about 9 years). So my\n",
    "first calculation was, “If this tumor grew at the median rate, how big\n",
    "would it have been at the date of discharge?”\n",
    "\n",
    "The median volume doubling time reported by Zhang et al is 811 days.\n",
    "Assuming 3-dimensional geometry, the doubling time for a linear measure\n",
    "is three times longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "        # time between discharge and diagnosis, in days \n",
    "        interval = 3291.0\n",
    "\n",
    "        # doubling time in linear measure is doubling time in volume * 3\n",
    "        dt = 811.0 * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "        # number of doublings since discharge\n",
    "        doublings = interval / dt\n",
    "\n",

    "        d1 = 15.5\n",
    "        d0 = d1 / 2.0 ** doublings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the code in this chapter from\n",
    "<http://thinkbayes.com/kidney.py>. For more information see\n",
    "Section [download].\n",
    "\n",
    "The result, <span>d0</span>, is about 6 cm. So if this tumor formed\n",
    "after the date of discharge, it must have grown substantially faster\n",
    "than the median rate. Therefore I concluded that it is “more likely than\n",
    "not” that this tumor formed before the date of discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I computed the growth rate that would be implied if this\n",
    "tumor had formed after the date of discharge. If we assume an initial\n",
    "size of 0.1 cm, we can compute the number of doublings to get to a final\n",
    "size of 15.5 cm:\n",
    "\n",
    "        # assume an initial linear measure of 0.1 cm\n",
    "        d0 = 0.1\n",
    "        d1 = 15.5\n",
    "\n",
    "        # how many doublings would it take to get from d0 to d1\n",
    "        doublings = log2(d1 / d0)\n",
    "\n",
    "        # what linear doubling time does that imply?\n",
    "        dt = interval / doublings\n",
    "\n",
    "        # compute the volumetric doubling time and RDT\n",
    "        vdt = dt / 3\n",
    "        rdt = 365 / vdt\n",
    "\n",
    "<span>dt</span> is linear doubling time, so <span>vdt</span> is\n",
    "volumetric doubling time, and <span>rdt</span> is reciprocal doubling\n",
    "time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of doublings, in linear measure, is 7.3, which implies an RDT\n",
    "of 2.4. In the data from Zhang et al, only 20% of tumors grew this fast\n",
    "during a period of observation. So again, I concluded that is “more\n",
    "likely than not” that the tumor formed prior to the date of discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "These calculations are sufficient to answer the question as posed, and\n",
    "on behalf of my correspondent, I wrote a letter explaining my\n",
    "conclusions to the Veterans’ Benefit Administration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later I told a friend, who is an oncologist, about my results. He was\n",
    "surprised by the growth rates observed by Zhang et al, and by what they\n",
    "imply about the ages of these tumors. He suggested that the results\n",
    "might be interesting to researchers and doctors.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in order to make them useful, I wanted a more general model of the\n",
    "relationship between age and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general model\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the size of a tumor at time of diagnosis, it would be most useful\n",
    "to know the probability that the tumor formed before any given date; in\n",
    "other words, the distribution of ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find it, I run simulations of tumor growth to get the distribution of\n",
    "size conditioned on age. Then we can use a Bayesian approach to get the\n",
    "distribution of age conditioned on size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation starts with a small tumor and runs these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Choose a growth rate from the distribution of RDT.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Compute the size of the tumor at the end of an interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Record the size of the tumor at each interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Repeat until the tumor exceeds the maximum relevant size.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the initial size I chose 0.3 cm, because carcinomas smaller than\n",
    "that are less likely to be invasive and less likely to have the blood\n",
    "supply needed for rapid growth (see\n",
    "<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinoma_in_situ>).\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose an interval of 245 days (about 8 months) because that is the\n",
    "median time between measurements in the data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the maximum size I chose 20 cm. In the data source, the range of\n",
    "observed sizes is 1.0 to 12.0 cm, so we are extrapolating beyond the\n",
    "observed range at each end, but not by far, and not in a way likely to\n",
    "have a strong effect on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Simulations of tumor growth, size vs. time.](figs/kidney4.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "[fig.kidney4]\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation is based on one big simplification: the growth rate is\n",
    "chosen independently during each interval, so it does not depend on age,\n",
    "size, or growth rate during previous intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section [serial] I review these assumptions and consider more\n",
    "detailed models. But first let’s look at some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure [fig.kidney4] shows the size of simulated tumors as a function of\n",

    "more than 35.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am presenting results in terms of linear measurements, but the\n",

    "<span>rho</span>. For example, when I generate 10000 values from the\n",
    "distribution of growth rates with <span>rho=0.4</span>, the actual\n",
    "correlation is 0.37. But since we are guessing at the right correlation\n",
    "anyway, that’s close enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that <span>MakeSequence</span> takes an iterator as an\n",
    "argument. That interface allows it to work with different generators:\n",
    "\n",
    "        iterator = UncorrelatedGenerator(cdf)\n",
    "        seq1 = MakeSequence(iterator)\n",
    "\n",
    "        iterator = CorrelatedGenerator(cdf, rho)\n",
    "        seq2 = MakeSequence(iterator)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, <span>seq1</span> and <span>seq2</span> are drawn from\n",
    "the same distribution, but the values in <span>seq1</span> are\n",
    "uncorrelated and the values in <span>seq2</span> are correlated with a\n",
    "coefficient of approximately <span>rho</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see what effect serial correlation has on the results; the\n",
    "following table shows percentiles of age for a 6 cm tumor, using the\n",
    "uncorrelated generator and a correlated generator with target\n",
    "$\\rho = 0.4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation makes the fastest growing tumors faster and the slowest\n",
    "slower, so the range of ages is wider. The difference is modest for low\n",
    "percentiles, but for the 95th percentile it is more than 6 years. To\n",
    "compute these percentiles precisely, we would need a better estimate of\n",
    "the actual serial correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this model is sufficient to answer the question we started\n",
    "with: given a tumor with a linear dimension of 15.5 cm, what is the\n",
    "probability that it formed more than 8 years ago?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # class Cache\n",
    "\n",
    "        def ProbOlder(self, cm, age):\n",
    "            bucket = CmToBucket(cm)\n",
    "            cdf = self.ConditionalCdf(bucket)\n",
    "            p = cdf.Prob(age)\n",
    "            return 1-p\n",
    "\n",
    "<span>cm</span> is the size of the tumor; <span>age</span> is the age\n",
    "threshold in years. <span>ProbOlder</span> converts size to a bucket\n",
    "number, gets the Cdf of age conditioned on bucket, and computes the\n",
    "probability that age exceeds the given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "With no serial correlation, the probability that a 15.5 cm tumor is\n",
    "older than 8 years is 0.999, or almost certain. With correlation 0.4,\n",
    "faster-growing tumors are more likely, but the probability is still\n",
    "0.995. Even with correlation 0.8, the probability is 0.978.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another likely source of error is the assumption that tumors are\n",
    "approximately spherical. For a tumor with linear dimensions 15.5 x 15\n",
    "cm, this assumption is probably not valid. If, as seems likely, a tumor\n",
    "this size is relatively flat, it might have the same volume as a 6 cm\n",
    "sphere. With this smaller volume and correlation 0.8, the probability of\n",
    "age greater than 8 is still 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "So even taking into account modeling errors, it is unlikely that such a\n",
    "large tumor could have formed less than 8 years prior to the date of\n",
    "diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we got through a whole chapter without using Bayes’s theorem or\n",
    "the <span>Suite</span> class that encapsulates Bayesian updates. What\n",
    "happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about Bayes’s theorem is as an algorithm for inverting\n",
    "conditional probabilities. Given <span>$\\mathrm{p}(B|A)$</span>, we can\n",
    "compute <span>$\\mathrm{p}(A|B)$</span>, provided we know\n",
    "<span>$\\mathrm{p}(A)$</span> and <span>$\\mathrm{p}(B)$</span>. Of course\n",
    "this algorithm is only useful if, for some reason, it is easier to\n",
    "compute <span>$\\mathrm{p}(B|A)$</span> than\n",
    "<span>$\\mathrm{p}(A|B)$</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, it is. By running simulations, we can estimate the\n",
    "distribution of size conditioned on age, or\n",
    "<span>$\\mathrm{p}(size|age)$</span>. But it is harder to get the\n",
    "distribution of age conditioned on size, or\n",
    "<span>$\\mathrm{p}(age|size)$</span>. So this seems like a perfect\n",
    "opportunity to use Bayes’s theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I didn’t is computational efficiency. To estimate\n",
    "<span>$\\mathrm{p}(size|age)$</span> for any given size, you have to run\n",
    "a lot of simulations. Along the way, you end up computing\n",
    "<span>$\\mathrm{p}(size|age)$</span> for a lot of sizes. In fact, you end\n",
    "up computing the entire joint distribution of size and age,\n",
    "<span>$\\mathrm{p}(size, age)$</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "And once you have the joint distribution, you don’t really need Bayes’s\n",
    "theorem, you can extract <span>$\\mathrm{p}(age|size)$</span> by taking\n",
    "slices from the joint distribution, as demonstrated in\n",
    "<span>ConditionalCdf</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we side-stepped Bayes, but he was with us in spirit.\n"
